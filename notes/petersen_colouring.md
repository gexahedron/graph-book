# Petersen colouring

## Strong Petersen colouring

Among small "nontrivial" snarks, only a small amount of them has oriented version of the colouring, which translates all oriented constructions, including o5cdc, o6c4c, o244-flows (so, for 28 or less vertices we have 3247 snarks, and only 8 of them have strong Petersen colouring):

- 10 vertices: Petersen graph
- 18, 20, 22, 24 vertices: none
- 26 vertices: g255, g280
- 28 vertices: g287, g2078, g2503, g2725, g2726

TODOs:
- check 30 vertices and more
- find generalized Blanusa snark of type 1 with an odd number of A-blocks in this list (26.05g255 or 26.05g280)
- check unit vector flows
