# Snarks, snark families, and Berge&ndash;Fulkerson conjecture

Vizingâ€™s Theorem specifies that the edge-chromatic number of a graph is no less than its maximal degree $\delta$ and no more than $\delta + 1$.

Here's a list of snark families with proven Berge&ndash;Fulkerson conjecture, which could be helpful for proving cases of orientable version.

"It has therefore become customary to define a snark as an uncolourable cubic cyclically 4-edge-connected graph with girth at least 5."

## Loupekhine (Loupekine) snarks of first and second kind

(For some reason, there are 2 versions of this snark family name)
