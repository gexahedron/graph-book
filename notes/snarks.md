# Snarks and snark families

Vizing’s Theorem specifies that the edge-chromatic number of a graph is no less than its maximal degree $\delta$ and no more than $\delta + 1$. So, this theorem splits graphs into 2 classes.

Snarks are cubic graphs, which definitely lie inside the class 2.

## Question of triviality
"It has therefore become customary to define a snark as an uncolourable cubic cyclically 4-edge-connected graph with girth at least 5."

TODO: why we ask for cyclically 4-edge connected cubic graphs, why not consider also cyclically 3-edge connected (same as 3-edge connected) graphs?

Also, here we consider snarks with girth > 3, so we don't include e. g. Tietze's graph. But usually, even girth 4 is considered as a trivial case.

## Petersen graph

## Descartes snark

## Szekeres snark

## Blanuša snarks of type 1 and 2

## Double-star snark

## Watkins snark

## BDS snarks

## Flower snarks

## Loupekhine (Loupekine) snarks of type 1 and 2

(For some reason, there are 2 versions of this snark family name)

## Permutation snarks

## Binary (Hist) snarks

## Máčajová-Škoviera rotation snarks

## TODO: Boolean snarks

## Small snarks (upto 36 vertices)

## Critical snarks

## Bicritical snarks

## Strictly critical snarks

There are no strictly critical snarks of any order smaller than 32.

There exist strictly critical snarks of order n for every even integer $n \ge 32$.

## Irreducible snarks

## Higher girth snarks

## 6-cyclically connected snarks

## TODO: not-(yet)-found snarks

- 7-cyclically connected snarks
- Cayley snarks

## TODO: Snark constructions

- dot product
- superposition
