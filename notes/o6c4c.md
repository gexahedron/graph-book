# Oriented Berge&ndash;Fulkerson conjecture

Here’s the solution for Petersen graph:

Oriented 6-cycle 4-cover for Petersen graph (matchings are shown as dotted edges)
```

We will abbreviate this construction as o6c4c.

## Snark families with o6c4c solutions

### Generalised Blanuša snark of type 1 with an odd number of A-blocks

Because this family of snarks has a strong Petersen coloring, we get a free result, that they also have a o6c4c solution.
