# Hypergraphs

In this note we will try to find analogues of various constructions in graph theory, related to the field of cycle double covers, specifically:
- What kind of hypergraphs should we consider?
- What is a bridge?
- What is a cycle?
- What kind of regular cover can they have?
- What is a flow and a nowhere-zero flow on hypergraphs?
- What is a perfect matching?
- Can we find a regular cover with perfect matchings?
- Can we find an analogue or orientable constructions and covers?
- What about signed analogues?
