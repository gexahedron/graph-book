    DONE: what is vector field?
        input: vertices, output: tangent space, so some formal weighted sum of edges, e. g.
        3e_1+1e_2-4e_3
        NOTE: antisymmetric field is also called a flow
    divergence-free <=> inflow=outflow for each vertex
        <=> solenoidal vector field

    DONE: what is curl on graphs?
        it should be sum of flows for each "face" (cycle? circuit?)

    DONE: Beltrami vector field
        a vector field in three dimensions that is parallel to its own curl
        I understand what is meant by parallel
        I need to understand the curl vector field though
        we need to define metric on the graph
    RESULT: I think curl is zero for antisymmetric flows on graphs
        because curl is symmetric

    Etnyre-Ghrist 1:
        In hydrodynamics, we consider the class of vector fields whose behavior is most fascinating and whose analysis has been most incomplete: these are the Beltrami fields, or fields which are parallel to their own curl.
        All such fields are steady solutions to Euler’s equations of motion for a perfect incompressible fluid.
        +
        Theorem The class of (nonsingular) vector fields on a three-manifold parallel to their (nonsingular) curl is identical to the class of Reeb fields under rescaling.

TODO: Poincare homology sphere
    - as a 3d continuous analog of Petersen graph
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_sphere
Alternatively, the Poincaré homology sphere can be constructed as the quotient space SO(3)/I where I is the icosahedral group (i.e., the rotational symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron, isomorphic to the alternating group A5). More intuitively, this means that the Poincaré homology sphere is the space of all geometrically distinguishable positions of an icosahedron (with fixed center and diameter) in Euclidean 3-space. One can also pass instead to the universal cover of SO(3) which can be realized as the group of unit quaternions and is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere. In this case, the Poincaré homology sphere is isomorphic to S^3/~I where ~I is the binary icosahedral group, the perfect double cover of I embedded in S^3.


my Q: my impression is that tight contact structures should correspond to snarks, in some way
        (maybe not)
    why such impression, e.g.:
    https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~vertesi/fikusz.pdf
        - Eliashberg proved classification of overtwisted structures
        - => tight contact structures are "interesting"
        - which corresponds with snarks are "interesting"

    but what if overtwisted contact structures correspond to snarks?
    an overtwisted disk would correspond to some kind of Petersen colouring, Petersen minor
    analogy could work smth like:
    - there exist ∞ many 3-manifold with no tight contact structure
    - e. g. nz6-flow (or nz5) exists for all bridgeless graphs
    - but, snarks don't have nz4-flow; so, tightness corresponds to 3-colouring

    - so, maybe snarks correspond to conditions of non-tightness
    - and also, very interestingly:
    https://etnyre.math.gatech.edu/preprints/papers/nocont.pdf
    - Theorem 1. There exist no positive tight contact structures on the Poincare homology sphere \Sigma(2; 3; 5) with reverse orientation.

TODO: Higher Ribbon Graphs, Arborealization program
https://www.math.princeton.edu/events/higher-ribbon-graphs-2018-03-12t200000
    Ribbon graphs capture the topology of open Riemann surfaces in an elementary combinatorial form. One can hope this is the first step toward a general theory for open symplectic manifolds such as Stein manifolds. We will discuss progress toward such a higher dimensional theory (joint work with Alvarez-Gavela, Eliashberg, and Starkston), and in particular, what kind of topological spaces might generalize graphs. We will also discuss applications to the calculation of symplectic invariants.

Intrinsically harmonic forms and characterization of flat circle bundles
Elizeu França, Francesco Mercuri
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14190
+
https://mathoverflow.net/a/342032/73702
    - A classical theorem due to Hodge states that in each De Rham’s cohomology class of a compact Riemannian manifold, there is one, and only one, harmonic form
    - Given a closed-form ω on a compact manifold M, is there a Riemannian metric g on M such that ω is harmonic concerning g?
    - If such a metric exists, ω is called an intrinsically harmonic form (I.H.)
    - Calabi showed that an 1-form ω is I.H., under suitable conditions on its zero-set, if and only if it is transitive.
    - Transitivity means that for every point x that is not a zero of ω, there is an embedded circle containing x, such that the restriction of ω to it never vanishes.
    - Honda proved a “dual” version of Calabi-Volkov’s result by showing that a transitive closed (n − 1)-form is I.H., under suitable conditions on its zero-set.
    - By a standard foliation’s argument, one can prove that nowhere-vanishing closed 1-form on a closed manifold is transitive, hence I.H.

    - Theorem 3. A differentiable principal circle bundle B = {B, p, M, S1}
        over a closed orientable base admits a flat connection, if and only if,
        one (and consequently all) of the four conditions below holds:
        (1) p∗(ΩM) is I.H.;
        (2) p∗(ΩM) determines a nonzero cohomology class;
        (3) the fiber represents a nonzero class in H1(B; R);
        (4) χ(B), the Euler’s class of B, is a torsion element.

    - my Q: I wonder whether we can interpret here
        flat connection as ocdc, and
        I.H. form as nz-flow?
    - We need to replace S1 with S2, probably?
        - do we assign a point on S2 to each vertex?
        - what does connection do then?
        - rotate the sphere?

Discrete Dirac operators on Riemann surfaces and Kasteleyn matrices
David Cimasoni
    In [5], we studied an explicit correspondance (first suggested by Kuperberg [16]) relating spin structures on 6 and Kasteleyn orientations

    (Spin; also, Pin+, Pin-, Spin-C, Spin-H structures)
    (r-Spin structures)

    my Q: existence of (S)pin structure <=> Petersen's theorem?

    A spin structure on a Riemann surface \Sigma may be thought of as a square root of the tangent bundle T-\Sigma
        which sounds kind of interesting already
        as if we try to replace ocdc with oc4c

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_structure
    Spin structures will exist if and only if the second Stiefel–Whitney class w2(M) ∈ H2(M, Z2) of M vanishes
    Furthermore, if w2(M) = 0, then the set of the isomorphism classes of spin structures on M is acted upon freely and transitively by H1(M, Z2)

    my Q: do we need something dual or transverse to spin structure?
    my Q: single spin structure probably corresponds to a single perfect matching
        but we want 6 of them in Berge-Fulkerson
        so probably we want something more from spin structures
    my Q: also, we have oriented and non-oriented vertices
        and rich and poor edges
        do we have something similar for spin structures?
    
    https://www.discretization.de/media/filer_public/2017/09/18/lecture_notes_berlin.pdf
    Summarizing this section so far, a dimer configuration D on X1 and a Kasteleyn orientation K on X determine a spin structure on Σ, i.e: a quadratic form q^K_D : H1(Σ; Z2) → Z2. Furthermore, this quadratic form can be computed explicitely.

A codimension one foliation F in M gives a globally defined notion of "horizontal" motion (motion restricted to a particular leaf) and "vertical" motion (motion always transverse to the leaves) through the manifold. Tautness means it is possible to get anywhere in M by vertical motion.

    6.8 Proposition: Let 𝑉 be a non singular vector field on 𝑀. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
    (i) The flow of 𝑉 is geodesible,
    (ii) there exist a 1-form 𝜒∈Ω1(𝑀) such that 𝜒(𝑉)>0 and 𝑖(𝑉)𝑑𝜒=0


Philippe Tondeur, Geometry of Foliations
A flow is geodesible, if there exists a Riemannian metric such that the leaves of F are geodesics. Note that for a flow this concept is equivalent to tautness.

Universality of Euler flows and flexibility of Reeb embeddings
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870823002852
The geometric content of the Beltrami fields was unveiled in [18,34],
where connections with Reeb fields of a contact structure and with geodesible flows were
established. This remarkable connection, which will be exploited in this paper, allows one
to bring tools from (high dimensional) contact topology to the analysis of the stationary
Euler equations provided that the Riemannian metric is not fixed, which is precisely the
context where Tao introduced the notion of universality

So, for each vertex x ∈ V, we will call the real vector space of formal linear combinations of the edges incident with x tangent space at x and we denote it by Tx(Γ). 
We will call any application f : V → \union_{x∈V} Tx(Γ) such that f(x) ∈ Tx(Γ) for each x ∈ V vector field on Γ
    so for each vertex we define some formal sum of it's edges,
    and this will be the vector field

TODO: there is very interesting conjecture about taut foliations for 3-spheres
Floer homology, group orderability, and taut foliations of hyperbolic 3-manifolds
https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04628
    - This paper explores the conjecture that the following are equivalent for rational homology 3-spheres: having left-orderable fundamental group, having non-minimal Heegaard Floer homology, and admitting a co-orientable taut foliation.


TODO: L-space conjecture
    - on the one hand we have a conjecture about having a co-orientable taut foliation
    https://adamjclay.github.io/Notes[3].pdf
        Conjecture 2.31. (The L-space conjecture, [6, Conjecture 1], [25, Conjecture 5]) Suppose that M
        is a compact, connected, orientable irreducible 3-manifold with finite first homology, other than S3.
        Then the following are equivalent:
        (1) M is not a Heegaard Floer homology L-space;
        (2) M admits a co-orientable taut foliation;
        (3) π1(M) is left-orderable.

        or there's cyclic cover version:
        Conjecture 2.32. (The L-space conjecture, circular orderability version, [1]). Suppose that M is
        a compact, connected, orientable irreducible 3-manifold with finite first homology that is not a lens
        space. Then the following are equivalent:
        (1) There exists a finite cyclic cover of M that is not an L-space.
        (2) There exists a finite cyclic cover of M that supports a co-orientable taut foliation.
        (3) The fundamental group of M is circularly orderable.
    
    - on the other hand, we have a conjecture for ocdc, that it exists for all bridgeless graphs
        - π1(G) is always a free group, so left-orderable, for any graph, so this is not very useful

    - Let M denote a compact, oriented 3-dimensional manifold and let a denote a contact 1-form on M; thus a /\ da is nowhere zero. This article proves that the vector field that generates the kernel of da has a closed integral curve.

    In the general case, we only have symplectic => volume preserving
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectomorphism
    Since symplectomorphisms preserve the symplectic 2-form and hence the symplectic volume form, Liouville's theorem in Hamiltonian mechanics follows. Symplectomorphisms that arise from Hamiltonian vector fields are known as Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms.
    If the first Betti number of a connected symplectic manifold is zero, symplectic and Hamiltonian vector fields coincide, so the notions of Hamiltonian isotopy and symplectic isotopy of symplectomorphisms coincide.
    It can be shown that the equations for a geodesic may be formulated as a Hamiltonian flow, see Geodesics as Hamiltonian flows.

book, Embedding Problems in Symplectic Geometry
    Symplectic geometry is the geometry underlying Hamiltonian dynamics, and symplectic mappings arise as time-1-maps of Hamiltonian flows. The spectacular rigidity phenomena for symplectic mappings discovered in the last two decades show that certain things cannot be done by a symplectic mapping. For instance, Gromov's famous "non-squeezing'' theorem states that one cannot map a ball into a thinner cylinder by a symplectic embedding. The aim of this book is to show that certain other things can be done by symplectic mappings. This is achieved by various elementary and explicit symplectic embedding constructions, such as "folding", "wrapping'', and "lifting''. These constructions are carried out in detail and are used to solve some specific symplectic embedding problems.

    Abstract. We survey the many new results on symplectic embeddings found over the last eight years. The focus is on motivations, connections, ideas, examples and open problems.

        - another is same glued vertex
    - 14 vertices = 1+6+6+1
    - 20 cubes: correspond to 20 original vertices of dodecahedron
    - 60 squares: 5 * 12 original faces of dodecahedron
    - every edge of DˆWS occurs in ≥ 4 cubes
