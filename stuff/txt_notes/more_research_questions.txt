Question 5.1. Does there exist a perfect matching on Jm, for m odd and m > 3, so that
the total face color polynomial is zero? More generally, when does a non-trivial snark have
zero total face color polynomial for some perfect matching?
Remark 5.2. If one passes to the blowup, the total face color polynomial is nontrivial if and
only if the graph has a cycle double cover. Question 5.1 is about whether the polynomial
can be zero when one does not first blow up and instead works with a perfect matching.
