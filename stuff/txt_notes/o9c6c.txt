- Results:
    - it seems the relations between variables are weaker than in o6c4c
    - s1 is quite big

- TODO: study Lovasz "matching lattice" paper, and maybe find connection to 9c6c

- TODO: can we find an o5cdc with "same"/corresponding cyclic order of edges ("same windings")?

- TODO: can we duplicate a 2-factor?

- TODO: compare profiles with other profiles
    although maybe it's not that interesting

- TODO: vertices:
    wind/unwind dichotomy
    but actually we have more information for unwind vertices
    they are also winding: 2 times in one cyclic edge order, 1 time in opposite order

    sounds like a ribbon graph

- TODO: edges:
    poor/rich dichotomy

- TODO: t1/t2/... edges:
    ...
