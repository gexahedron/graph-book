# Graph Book

## plans for the week, 08.01-14.01:
- write-up S2 nz5 counterexample
- recheck rich_type_count
- глянуть статью A state sum for the total face color polynomial
- recheck code that's not part of unified experiments folder
    - 33pp_from_nz5
- o244=9 - how close can we be to a strong Petersen colouring?
- find
    - 244-flows, which is not o244-flows
    - 333-flows, which is not o333-flows
    - o334-flows, where there's no o333-flows
- 33pp from nz5 - check 134 vertices
    - find examples where we don't have a cycle in (1,2)-graph
- nz5 vs 33pp - count both; or match them to each other
- check remark:
    - интересно, что в графе петерсена одно nz5 порождает 2 разных o5cdc
    - можно ли из них что-нибудь слепить ещё?
    - o2233-flows?
- run has_nz5 for 26.05, compare with has_nzmodb
- check has_nz5 for interesting parameters
- render book
- построить nz5 по o6c4c (через libarmadillo)
    - поискать pinv, mat, EPS, norm
    cmake -DALLOW_BLAS_LAPACK_MACOS=ON .
    sudo make install
- study Fan-Raspaud triples
- study even cycles (which appear in [o]244-flows)
- retry 333-flows from o6c4c and other stories
- o2233-flows vs o5cdc
- create DB, at least for o6c4c solutions
    - actually several DBs
        - per snark
        - per solution
- add 1 counterexample
    - 3BMs
    - 234-flows
- after DB: compare statements, 6c4c vs o6c4c
    - s1 >= 15
    - has_2cdcs
- identify some snarks in HoG db
- write out statements of conjectures
- clean up o6c4c code
- write some proofs for practicing
- check example where we have 33pp, but not 333pp

## My successes:
- S2 nz6
    - + mysterious count of neighbour quintuples of colors for icosidodecahedron, it was always 26
- o6c4c
- o6c4c or_sums; 2 approaches
- some counterexamples
- openproblemgarden errata
- 5cdc from nz5 (through 33pp)
* code for strong Petersen colouring conjecture and getting list of snarks with it
* oriented 9-cycle 6-cover conjecture (o9c6c) (but not for Petersen graph, because it doesn't have any 9-cycle 6-cover)
* investigations into common nowhere-zero 5-flows which come from 2BMs, 3BMs, o5cdc, o6c4c

C++ code:
- maintain dependencies through optional classes; if they null - then we forgot to init them
- define customized Graph class always in main.cpp
    - and then we probably don’t even need the concepts!
- FUTURE: create python bindings
    - TODO: there maybe a problem with multiple inheritance
    - maybe I should have only 1 graph class then
    - which contains all extensions

TODO: does having Petersen coloring for snarks imply in some sense having a Petersen graph minor? and if so, proving snark theorem, and if so proving 4CT?

not CQ Zhang:
- NP-completeness
- o5cdc papers:
    - Theorem 8.1.1. Every generalised Blanuša snark of type 1 with an odd number of A-blocks is strongly Petersen colourable.

        - zero-sum flows
        - ? oriented? oriented Fano plane?
        - ? coloring
        - ? transversals; perfect matchings
        - ? o?c3c; ? 7c3c
        - ? other triple systems (Hall, …)
        - ? matroids (Sylvester matroid), polynomials

    - conjecture - every orientation of a simple planar graph can be acyclically colored with two colors
    - https://mathoverflow.net/questions/255409/do-planar-graphs-have-an-acyclic-two-coloring
- NZflows and Hadwiger’s conjecture
- Berge-Fulkerson conjecture / 244-flows
- o6c4c / Oriented Berge-Fulkerson conjecture

- 3 disjoint BMs, my counterexample
- more counterexamples
    - In other words, if a snark is “critical” with respect to Berge-Fulkerson’s Conjecture, then it seems to be critical also for the 5-flow Conjecture. The converse is false.

        - +
        - given any collection of disjoint odd circuits in G, there exists a perfect matching of G containing at least one edge of each circuit in this collection
