# Graph Book

# Some caveats, for me; what results need to be rechecked:
- o5cdc
- Petersen colouring
- 2BM/3BM
...


## plans for the week, 15.01-21.01:
- Petersen colouring code was WRONG
    - specifically, profiles were WRONG (everything else seems to be ok)
    - so, we need to recheck everything about petersen profiles at least
        - o6c4c_and_petersen_colouring
        - onlyrich
        - ? strong Petersen colouring
        - groupings by profile (bipartite smth)
        - counts of poor edges
        - petersen_always_rich
        - petersen_always_poor
- links:

    https://houseofgraphs.org/meta-directory/snarks#circular_flow_5
- o6c4c, where poor edges form a cutset
- 20.05g1 is a flower snark!
- Petersen graph "4-pole", 22.05g11
    also check 20.05g1
? G ---Z3--> H (333-flows)
- petersen colourings и совпадение по 5cdc (там какое-то диковинное паросочетание)
    - RECHECK, because code was WRONG
- интересно ли это?
    26.05, 28.05:
        (s1 + s2 + odd_poor_full_cycles) по модулю 2 всегда даёт 1
        это легко доказать
        поэтому odd_poor_full_cycles не нужен
        поэтому вопрос про parity сводится скорее к совпадению чётностей
        s0 и odd_poor_full_cycles
- Corollary 5.16. All cyclically 4-edge connected cubic graphs on n  36 vertices, except the Petersen graph, have an even cycle double cover
- Space vectors forming rational angles - study how icosidodecahedron appears there
- For history: I think this is the first mention of s0, s1, s2:
    - Theorem 1. Let s0, s1 and s2 be respectively the number of (topological) minima, saddle points and maxima of the distance functions d or g. We have:
- o6c4c_and_petersen_colouring - графы, где у o6c4c и petersen colouring совпадает набор poor рёбер
- Paper on unit vector flows:
    - S2: Petersen graph = icosidodecahedron
    - S2, strong Petersen colouring
    - S2, Tietze's graph
    - S2, other snarks!
    - S2: nz6 counterexample
    - S3: 20 points is enough, unit vector flows from o5cdc and oriented Desargues configuration
    - Hopf map S3->S2
    - pose more open problems
    + classic stuff
        - write-up how 5cdc gives S4 unit vector flow
            Celmins [3] and Preissmann [13] conjectured that every 2-edge-connected-graph
            has a collection of five even subgraphs so that every edge is in exactly two of these subgraphs.
            If true, that would imply that every 2-edge-connected graph has a 5-dimensional unit distance flow.

- TODO: {rich o6c4c == rich petersen} < {? RP2, wat == has_2cdcs}
- глянуть статью A state sum for the total face color polynomial
- recheck code that's not part of unified experiments folder
    - 33pp_from_nz5
    - Riemann surface, and Petersen graph group calculation
- o244=9 - how close can we be to a strong Petersen colouring?
- find
    - 244-flows, which is not o244-flows
    - 333-flows, which is not o333-flows
    - o334-flows, where there's no o333-flows
- 33pp from nz5 - check 134 vertices
    - find examples where we don't have a cycle in (1,2)-graph
- nz5 vs 33pp - count both; or match them to each other
- check remark:
    - интересно, что в графе петерсена одно nz5 порождает 2 разных o5cdc
    - можно ли из них что-нибудь слепить ещё?
    - o2233-flows?
- run has_nz5 for 26.05, compare with has_nzmodb
- check has_nz5 for interesting parameters
- render book
- построить nz5 по o6c4c (через libarmadillo)
    - поискать pinv, mat, EPS, norm
    cmake -DALLOW_BLAS_LAPACK_MACOS=ON .
    sudo make install
- study Fan-Raspaud triples
- study even cycles (which appear in [o]244-flows)
- retry 333-flows from o6c4c and other stories
- o2233-flows vs o5cdc
- create DB, at least for o6c4c solutions
    - actually several DBs
        - per snark
        - per solution
- add 1 counterexample
    - 3BMs
    - 234-flows
- after DB: compare statements, 6c4c vs o6c4c
    - s1 >= 15
    - has_2cdcs
- identify some snarks in HoG db
- write out statements of conjectures
- clean up o6c4c code
- write some proofs for practicing
- check example where we have 33pp, but not 333pp

- o6c4c
- o6c4c or_sums; 2 approaches
- some counterexamples
- openproblemgarden errata
- 5cdc from nz5 (through 33pp)
* code for strong Petersen colouring conjecture and getting list of snarks with it
* oriented 9-cycle 6-cover conjecture (o9c6c) (but not for Petersen graph, because it doesn't have any 9-cycle 6-cover)
* investigations into common nowhere-zero 5-flows which come from 2BMs, 3BMs, o5cdc, o6c4c

C++ code:
- maintain dependencies through optional classes; if they null - then we forgot to init them
- define customized Graph class always in main.cpp
    - and then we probably don’t even need the concepts!
- FUTURE: create python bindings
    - TODO: there maybe a problem with multiple inheritance
    - maybe I should have only 1 graph class then

Backlog:
- S2 unit vector flow for Tietze's graph
    - problem is we need to rotate cuboctahedron coordinates
- S2 unit vector flow for Blanusa snarks
    - no idea how to do it
    - and we also need to understand,
    what is the obstruction to oriented Desargues configuration in S2
    why can't we find 10 pairs of opposite points
