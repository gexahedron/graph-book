            - Noether's Theorem. If W is not hyperelliptic, then every quadratic differential on W can be written as the sum of (three) products of abelian differentials.
        - probably they are all hyperbolic
        Suppose X is a compact Riemann surface of genus g. If g‚â•2, then it is not homeomorphic to the sphere ‚Ñô1 nor the torus. Thus, X admits a hyperbolic complex structure.

cycle-double-covers: Three 4-flows conjecture
gexahedron; The Gitter Badger

Note about 233-flows:

The conjecture about 233-flows, stated in the last section in openproblemgarden text is already false for Petersen graph (234-flows also don't exist for Petersen graph).

Looks like there do exist 333-flows and 244-flows for all snarks (verified for all snarks with 10, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26 vertices).

Also looks like almost all snarks have 233-flows. Here are the exceptions (cyclically 5-edge-connected snarks, enumeration is taken from "House of Graphs" databases, starting from 1):

10 vertices: g1 (no 233- and no 234- flows)
18 vertices: no exceptions
20 vertices: g1 (no 233- and no 234- flows)
22 vertices: g6 (no 233-flows)
24 vertices: g7, g12, g26, g29 (no 233-flows)
26 vertices: g62, g67, g88, g89, g93, g98, g109, g119, g138, g143, g166, g177, g189, g191, g203, g246, g277 (no 233-flows); g141 (no 233- and no 234- flows)
