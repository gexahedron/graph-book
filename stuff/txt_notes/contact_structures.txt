        Some Tight Contact Manifolds Are Tighter Than Others
    hypertight
    universally tight

        Universally tight contact structures with universal cover R3 are rather close in spirit to taut foliations. In fact, a small perturbation of a taut foliation into a contact structure is universally tight, due to the work of Eliashberg and Thurston [5].
    virtually overtwisted
        same as stably overtwisted
    strongly overtwisted
    flexible Weinstein fillings
    exact Lagrangian fillings
    Liouville fillings
    +
    Milnor fillable
        Milnor fillable contact structures are universally tight
    Bourgeois contact structures
    spherical contact structures
    exotic contact structures
    planar contact structures
    induced contact structures (induced by geodesic fields)
    weakly compatible contact structures
    strongly compatible contact structures
    asymptotically finitely generated contact structures
    invariant contact structure
    bi-contact structures
    real contact structures
        real tight contact structures
        real Milnor filling


btw, compare with foliations (on graph manifolds):

    foliations without Reeb components
    taut foliations
    foliations with no S1xS1-leaves
