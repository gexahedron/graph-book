conjectures:
    - total_poor_comps > 1
    - odd_poor_2-factors = 0
    - s2 is either 0 or 3
    
    - if the solution is orientable (so we have o6c4c) then
        - s0 is even
        - or + s1 is even (or same as saying that t4 is even)

todo:
    - if s0 even - is solution always orientable?
    
    - are there graphs without 2x6cdcs?
