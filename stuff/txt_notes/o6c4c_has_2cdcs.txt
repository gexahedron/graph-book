Main question: why s0 is even?
    - TODO: try to glue circuits into a "polyhedron"
    - or maybe 2 polyhedrons


- DONE: hierarchy and relationships:
    - rich_type_count=12
    - also_uvf (also_pet + 333-flows + or_as_unor_triples_244_count=1)
        - TODO: also_pet + 333-flows
            - also_pet
                - has_2cdcs
                    - has_2richcdcs
                    - r244odd=0
                    - all_or_nonsplit
                - mappable
                    - r244odd=0
                - no_rich_chords
                    - no t4 chords
                - rich_edge_pair_evens=0,15
            - frac_nz5:10010100
                - frac_nz5:1
                    - 333-flows

    - NOTE: has_2cdcs + "no rich chords" doesn't imply also_pet
        (but they seem to be kind-of similar)
    - NOTE: has_2richcdcs + "mappable + all_or_strong_nonsplit" doesn't imply has_2cdcs


- TODO: rich_type_count vs uvf-flow
- TODO: has_2richcdcs
- TODO: mappable
- TODO: r244odd=0
- TODO: no t4 chords

- TODO: has_2cdcs + "no rich chords" ; vs also_pet
    - DONE: looks, like it's the same set of graphs (upto 26.05 at least)
        UPD: it's not
    - TODO: it also feels, like they could "behave similarly"
        maybe we could reconstruct one from another
        - DONE: check circuit lengths in "mappable"

- DONE: if "no rich chords" and rich_type_count<=15, then also_pet
    fails on 38.06
